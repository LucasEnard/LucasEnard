## About Me

French student with a passion for computer science.

My training, MPSI/MP*, at the Camille-Guérin high school in preparatory class for the grandes écoles
allowed me to obtain an important theoretical knowledge in all the scientific subjects as well as a great rigor in my work.
Moreover, during this training I was able to develop advanced autonomy, thinking and communication skills.

My current training as a generalist engineer at ESILV Paris La Défense allows me to apply my theoretical knowledge to many practical cases as well as to develop my SoftSkills such as team management and communication.

During my 4th year internship at InterSystems France I was able to learn a lot about the business world and customer relations while developing new skills in IT.

**Currently looking for an enginer internship in IT / Data / AI for March 2023**
